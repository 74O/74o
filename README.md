## Hi there 👋 I'm 74o

I really don't know how to introduce myself.
I'm a self taught enthusiast for everything related to IT and Linux; i just like to learn and try making (and sometimes breaking) new things.
This is my 127.0.0.1, my playground.

I use this account for my projects and experiments.
Currently, I am:
- 🖥️ Figuring how to self host my projects.
- 🧠 
- 🎓 Studying python 🐍

My skills are:
- Linux (+ bash) (Arch + Debian)
- Vim (neovim + learning Lua)
- Apache
- Mysql
- PHP
- JavaScript
- SSH
- VPN
- Networking
- Virtualization

I also like the physical world!
- 3D printing
- Arduino
- ESP32
