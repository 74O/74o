## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm 74o

I really don't know how to introduce myself.
I'm a self taught enthusiast for everything related to IT and Linux; i just like to learn and try making (and sometimes breaking) new things.

This is my 127.0.0.1, my playground.

I use this account for my projects and experiments.
