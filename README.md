## Hi there 👋 I'm 74o

I really don't know how to introduce myself.
I'm a self taught enthusiast for everything related to IT and Linux; i just like to learn and try making (and sometimes breaking) new things.
<!--
As i never liked to follow the *conventional* path (neither in the academic world nor in the professional) I had to build myself a set of skills as long as i learn  or discover new concepts in the way; leading me to have a wide range of knowledge
I have never had **yet** a serious job in IT, *which i'd love to*, hence my lack of experience in many areas; but i'm igger to adopt new methodologies and am capable of adapting myself to any working environment. I'm all about learning new stuff after all!
-->
This is my 127.0.0.1, my playground. 
I use this account for my projects and experiments.
I don't usually have many public repo's as I feel my code mine and very private (also i'm afraid of other's oppinions). However, i do support and am very thankful of Open Source, which I widely use in all my projects. 

My skills are:
- Linux (+ bash) (Arch + Debian)
- Vim (neovim + learning Lua)
- Apache
- Mysql
- PHP
- JavaScript
- SSH
- VPN
- Networking
- Virtualization

I also like the physical world!
- 3D printing
- Arduino
- ESP32

Currently, I am:
- 🖥️ Figuring how to self host my projects.
- 🧠 
- 🎓 Studying python 🐍
